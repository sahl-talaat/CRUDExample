CRUDExample Solution -  A structured ASP.NET Core solution demonstrating clean architecture 
                        and test-driven development for a simple CRUD application.


The solution is organized into multiple projects following separation of concerns:

    . CRUDExample (Web App) - ASP.NET Core application exposing the CRUD endpoints  
    and handling requests.

    . Entities - Domain models (e.g., Country) representing core business data.

    . ServiceContracts - Interfaces and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) 
    that define contracts for services and enforce consistency between layers.

    . Services - Concrete implementations of the business logic defined in ServiceContracts.

    . CRUDTests - Unit tests (xUnit) ensuring correctness of business logic 
    and validating service behavior.

This structure makes the solution easy to maintain, extend, 
and test, while adhering to clean architecture principles 
(Domain → Contracts → Services → Application → Tests).
